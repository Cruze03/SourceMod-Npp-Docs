# SourceMod-Npp-Docs
[![GitHub release](https://img.shields.io/github/release/raziEiL/SourceMod-Npp-Docs.svg?colorB=97CA00?label=version)](https://github.com/raziEiL/SourceMod-Npp-Docs/releases/latest)
[![Donate](https://img.shields.io/badge/Donate-PayPal-green.svg)](https://www.paypal.me/razicat)   
Here the new API docs with all (I hope) function, define, enum, methodmap and fixed xml structure. Docs were generated by reworked generator plugin.

# Plugin

### Features:
 - Generate auto-completion files.
 - Generate inline docs (*sourcemod.xml*).
 - Supports SourceMod 1.7 API specifics.
 
### Changes:
 - Added better way to detect commentary.
 - Added methods docs.
 - Added more console stats.
 - Added xml filter.
 - Code optimization.
 - Detects all function params.
 - Detects enum & define correctly.
 - Detects methodmap selection.
 - Detects typeset.
 - Makes keywords to pop up correctly.

 
### Server command:
**sm_makedocs** - starts to parse SourceMod includes and generates output files.

# Notepad++
**SourceMod docs** files are located in the **plugins\NPP\\** subfolder of sourcemod folder.  
**Notepad++ API** files are located in the **plugins\APIs\\** subfolder of the Notepad++ installation folder.  
**Notepad++ API v7.6+** files are located in the **autoCompletion\\** subfolder of the Notepad++ installation folder.

>**Note:** Use **sm_makedocs** command to generate docs or get them from the [latest release](https://github.com/raziEiL/SourceMod-Npp-Docs/releases/latest)).

## Highlights
### Use preset
A preset has all the setting ready to developing your plugin. To load preset go to **Notepd++ -> Lanuguage -> Define your language -> Import** and select **userDefineLang.xml** from **SourceMod docs** or copy **userDefineLang.xml** to **<USER_NAME>\AppData\Roaming\Notepad++\\**  

If you want to use with twilight theme:
*Disable global foreground color*
*Enable global background color*
*Enable global bold font style*
P.S:- Background black not black enough? Select bacckground color selection and select black again.

### Define you own preset
If you want to configurate user defined languge or update keywords, check **plugins\NPP\\** folder for **NPP_STYLE** files. These files contain defining the keyword lists for the SourcePawn language. Open one of those files, select keywords and copy. Go to **Notepd++ -> Lanuguage -> Define your language...** Select you own language or create new and past keywords to the Keywords Lists group. Do it for other groups too. More information here: [UDL 2.0](https://udl20.weebly.com/index.html).

>**Note:** It's important to define your language as **sourcemod**

## Autocompletion
Copy **sourcemod.xml** file from **SourceMod docs** folder to **Notepad++ API** folder. Done! 
Due to Notepad++ **Issues** I highly recommend using [**3P plugin**](https://jcaillon.github.io/3P/ " 3D plugin") for autocompletion feature. Otherwise, you can use default Notepad++ autocompletion feature (don't forget to read about **Issues**). The completion list can be triggered automatically as you type, via settings in **Settings -> Preferences -> Auto-Completion:** Auto-Completion is enabled by a checkbox. Additionally there is a setting "From X th character", accepting a the minimum length of a prefix needed before the completion list is shown (some people like 2, some 3, some 4...); and, there is a setting to specify which candidates should be used: words, functions, or both.
>**Note:** Press **TAB** to fast autocompletion.  
>**Note:** To watch docs again place the cursor between `( )` characters and press **CTRL+SHIFT+SPACE** hotkeys

# Methodmap notes
![Docs screenshot](https://github.com/raziEiL/SourceMod-Npp-Docs/blob/master/img/docs%20list.png "Inline docs: methodmap strings")  
These strings are not actual SourceMod functions. The purpose of these strings is to provide access to documentation showing the methodmap structure. Notepad++ don't reacts on dots in names (exp: fileArray.GetString) and docs not shown, so `.` were separated with `_` symbol.
>**Note:** If you want to use string as code you must remove prefix and separate `_` with `.`  
>**Note:** If you want to watch docs you must do the vice versa.

## Prefix structure:

| MM (Methodmap) type | With tag | Without tag |
|------| ------ | ------ |
| C (Constructor) | MM_`%1`_`%2`\_C\_`%3` | MM_`%1`\_C_`%3` |
| M (Method) | MM_`%1`_`%2`_M\_`%3` | MM_`%1`\_M_`%3` |
| P (Property) | MM_`%1`_`%2`_P\_`%3` | MM_`%1`_P\_`%3` |

Where: `%1` - Class name, `%2` - Tag name, `%3` - Real method/property/constructor name.
>**Note:** **Prefix** - a string before `%3` param (e.g., `MM_ArrayList_Handle_M_`GetArray).

## Examples:

| MM (Methodmap) type | With tag                   | Without tag                |
|---------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|
| C (Constructor)     | MM_Menu_Handle_C_Menu      | Always has the tag         |
| M (Method)          | MM_Menu_Handle_M_ToPanel   | MM_AdminId_M_BindIdentity  |
| P (Property)        | MM_Menu_Handle_P_ItemCount | MM_AdminId_P_ImmunityLevel |

**Editing string to watch docs:**  
Method: ToPanel()  
Prefix: MM_Menu_Handle_M_  
Result: MM_Menu_Handle_M_ToPanel

**Editing string to use as code:**  
Docs string: MM_AdminId_P_ImmunityLevel  
Removes prefix: MM_AdminId_M_  
Result: my_code.ImmunityLevel() 

# Issues
The following **Issues** were [reported](https://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/issues/4833 "reported") on notepad-plus-plus repository.
1. Code-complete-file defined with `ignoreCase="yes"` input makes autocomplete work incorrectly.
2. Code-complete-file defined with `ignoreCase="no"` input makes pop up docs work incorrectly for functions with a similar names (e.g., ReplaceStringEx hint docs from ReplaceString).

By deafault code-complete-file defined with`ignoreCase="yes"` input, because it did less harm. So, keep in mind about **issues #1**.
> **Note:** For changing `ignoreCase` attribute edit sourcemod.xml file.
